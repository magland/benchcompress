# Functional MRI Dataset

This dataset contains functional MRI (fMRI) data from a study investigating neural activity elicited by the diminished seventh chord in listeners with refined music listening skills.

## Data Source

The data comes from OpenNeuro dataset [ds005880](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds005880/versions/1.0.1) titled "BIDS Dataset for the Diminished Seventh Chord". The specific data used is a single functional run from subject 01.

Data were acquired at Imaging Center for Integrated Body, Mind, and Culture Research at National Taiwan University using a 3T MR system (MAGNETOM Prisma, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).

## Dataset Details

- Type: BOLD fMRI timeseries
- Format: 4D NIfTI file (3D volumes over time)
- Data type: 16-bit integers
- Content: Represents changes in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal over time
- Structure: Each timepoint is a 3D brain volume showing neural activity patterns
